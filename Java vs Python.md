# Difference between Java & Python

## Class
- Java is *pure object-oriented language*, so all code `must be contained in class to run`, there is no place for executable place outside a class
- while Python is more plexible with *multiple programming style*; code can `not wrapped by any class or function`
    - e.g. *print("Hello")* is ok

|exponentiation|needs to call ```Math.pow()```|use```**```|
|increment/decrement|supports ```++``` , ```--``` and ```x+=1/x-=1```|can ```only use x+=1/x-=1```|
|modulus|the ```result sign``` is the same as the ```dividend```|the ```result sign``` is the same as the ```divisor```|
